# Welcome to your Expo app 👋

This is an [Expo](https://expo.dev) project created with [`create-expo-app`](https://www.npmjs.com/package/create-expo-app).

## Get started

1. Install dependencies

   ```bash
   pnpm install
   ```

2. Start the app

   ```bash
   pnpm start
   ```

In the output, you'll find options to open the app in a

- [development build](https://docs.expo.dev/develop/development-builds/introduction/)
- [Android emulator](https://docs.expo.dev/workflow/android-studio-emulator/)
- [iOS simulator](https://docs.expo.dev/workflow/ios-simulator/)
- [Expo Go](https://expo.dev/go), a limited sandbox for trying out app development with Expo

You can start developing by editing the files inside the **app** directory. This project uses [file-based routing](https://docs.expo.dev/router/introduction).

## Get a fresh project

When you're ready, run:

```bash
pnpm run reset-project
```

This command will move the starter code to the **app-example** directory and create a blank **app** directory where you can start developing.

## Learn more

To learn more about developing your project with Expo, look at the following resources:

- [Learn Expo tutorial](https://docs.expo.dev/tutorial/introduction/): Follow a step-by-step tutorial where you'll create a project that runs on Android, iOS, and the web.

## E2E Testing with Maestro

This project uses [Maestro](https://maestro.mobile.dev/) for end-to-end testing.

### Install Maestro CLI

**macOS/Linux:**
```bash
curl -Ls "https://get.maestro.mobile.dev" | bash
```

**Verify installation:**
```bash
maestro --version
```

### Prerequisites

1. Build a development build (Maestro requires Expo development builds, not Expo Go):
   - iOS: `pnpm run ios` or `npx expo run:ios`
   - Android: `pnpm run android` or `npx expo run:android`

2. Ensure a simulator/emulator is running

### Running E2E Tests

```bash
# Run all test flows
maestro test .maestro/flows/

# Run a specific flow
maestro test .maestro/flows/example.yaml
```

For more information, see [.maestro/README.md](.maestro/README.md).
