# Cursor Rules for Battle Blocks Scorecard

## Package Manager
This project uses **pnpm** as the package manager. Always use `pnpm` instead of `npm` for all package management commands:

- Use `pnpm install` instead of `npm install`
- Use `pnpm run <script>` instead of `npm run <script>`
- Use `pnpm add <package>` instead of `npm install <package>`
- Use `pnpm exec <command>` instead of `npx <command>` when appropriate

The project has a `pnpm-lock.yaml` file, confirming pnpm is the package manager.

## Examples
- ✅ `pnpm run lint`
- ✅ `pnpm test`
- ✅ `pnpm install`
- ❌ `npm run lint`
- ❌ `npm test`
- ❌ `npm install`
