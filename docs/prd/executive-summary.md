# Executive Summary

**Product Vision:** Battle Blocks Scorecard is a mobile app that replaces paper-based scorekeeping for the Battle Blocks throwing game with automatic rule enforcement and reliable local data persistence.

**Product Differentiator:** Automatic enforcement of game rules (50+ penalty, elimination tracking) eliminates manual calculations and errors, enabling players to focus on gameplay rather than scorekeeping.

**Target Users:** Players of Battle Blocks (ages 6+) who want a reliable, paperless way to track scores during games with friends and family.

**Platform:** Cross-platform mobile app (iOS and Android) built with React Native and Expo, designed for fully offline operation with local database persistence.

**Project Context:** Greenfield project - learning-focused React Native development demonstrating production-ready mobile app skills while building a useful personal tool.
