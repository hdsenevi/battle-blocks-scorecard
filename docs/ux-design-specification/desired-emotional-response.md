# Desired Emotional Response

## Primary Emotional Goals

Users should feel **confident and trusting** that the app handles scorekeeping reliably, allowing them to focus on gameplay without worry. The primary emotional goal is to create a sense of relief from manual calculations and paper tracking, enabling users to concentrate on the game itself rather than scorekeeping mechanics.

**Core Emotional States:**
- **Confident**: The app handles everything correctly, no need to double-check calculations
- **Relieved**: No manual calculations or paper tracking required
- **Focused**: Can concentrate on gameplay, not scorekeeping logistics
- **Trusting**: Automatic rule enforcement works accurately and transparently

## Emotional Journey Mapping

**First Discovery:**
Users should feel curious but confident - the interface appears simple and immediately understandable, reducing initial anxiety about learning a new tool.

Users should feel focused and in control - score entry is fast and clear, requiring minimal cognitive load. They experience trust as rules enforce automatically with transparent feedback.

**After Completing Task (Game Completion):**
Users should feel satisfied and accomplished - the game completed smoothly without needing paper or manual calculations. They experience delight when automatic rule enforcement works seamlessly.

**When Something Goes Wrong:**
Users should feel reassured - clear error messages and easy recovery paths maintain trust. They remain confident that data is safe and games can be resumed.

**Returning to Use Again:**
Users should feel confident and familiar - the app has proven reliable, data persists correctly, and the interface remains intuitive. They trust the system will work as expected.

## Micro-Emotions

**Critical Micro-Emotions:**
- **Confidence vs. Confusion**: Users must understand game state instantly with zero ambiguity about scores, leader position, and rule enforcement

- **Accomplishment vs. Frustration**: Completing games without friction creates a sense of accomplishment and competence

**Emotions to Avoid:**
- Confusion from unclear game state or rule enforcement
- Skepticism about rule enforcement accuracy
- Frustration from slow entry, lost data, or errors
- Anxiety about losing game progress

## Design Implications

**Building Confidence and Trust:**
- Clear visual feedback for all actions (instant score updates, visible rule enforcement)

- Reliable data persistence (prominent "Continue Game" option, clear game status indicators)
- Error prevention and clear error recovery paths

**Creating Delight:**
- Automatic rule enforcement with satisfying visual/haptic feedback creates moments of delight
- Game completion celebration reinforces accomplishment
- Smooth, instant score updates feel magical and effortless

**Avoiding Negative Emotions:**
- Fast score entry prevents frustration (large touch targets, clear distinction between single/multiple blocks)

- Clear visual hierarchy prevents confusion (instant game state visibility, prominent leader indication)
- Transparent rule enforcement prevents skepticism (users see rules trigger, understand what happened)

**Emotion-Design Connections:**
- **Confidence** → Instant clarity of game state, transparent rule enforcement, reliable persistence
- **Trust** → Accurate automatic behaviors, clear visual feedback, error prevention
- **Relief** → No manual calculations, automatic rule tracking, effortless score entry
- **Delight** → Satisfying haptic feedback, smooth animations, automatic rule enforcement moments

## Emotional Design Principles

1. **Transparency Builds Trust**: All automatic behaviors (rule enforcement, data saving) must be visible and understandable. Users should see what's happening and why.

2. **Instant Feedback Creates Confidence**: Immediate visual and haptic responses to user actions build confidence that the system is working correctly and responsively.

3. **Reliability Eliminates Anxiety**: Consistent, automatic data persistence and error-free operation eliminate worry about losing progress or making mistakes.

4. **Effortless Interactions Create Delight**: When score entry and rule enforcement feel completely natural and require zero thought, users experience delight in the seamless experience.

5. **Clear Communication Prevents Confusion**: Visual hierarchy, clear game state indicators, and transparent rule enforcement prevent confusion and build understanding.
