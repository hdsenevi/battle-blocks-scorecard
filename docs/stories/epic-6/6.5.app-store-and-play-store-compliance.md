## Status
Draft

## Story

**As a** developer,
**I want** the app to comply with App Store and Play Store requirements,
**so that** the app can be submitted and published to app stores.

## Acceptance Criteria

1. **Given** the app is ready for store submission
2. **When** I review store requirements
3. **Then** the app meets:
   - App Store Review Guidelines (iOS)
   - Google Play Developer Policy (Android)
   - Required privacy disclosures
   - Age/content rating requirements
   - App icons and screenshots prepared
4. **And** privacy policy is accessible within the app (FR52)
5. **And** the app includes required privacy disclosures
6. **And** store listing materials are prepared
7. **And** the app is tested for store compliance
8. **And** a Maestro automation test flow is created in `.maestro/flows/` that:
    - Launches the app and verifies basic functionality works
    - Verifies privacy policy is accessible within the app
    - Verifies the app meets basic store compliance requirements (no crashes, proper navigation)
    - The test flow is added to the automation regression suite

**FRs covered:** FR50, FR51, FR52, NFR28, NFR29, NFR30, NFR32, NFR33, NFR34
