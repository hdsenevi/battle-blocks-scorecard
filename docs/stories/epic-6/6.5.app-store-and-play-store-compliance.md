1. **App Store Review Guidelines Compliance**: App meets iOS App Store requirements:
   - App functions as described (all features work correctly)
   - Privacy: No user data collection (local-only SQLite database)
   - Content: Age-appropriate (simple game scoring, no objectionable content)
   - Design: Follows iOS design guidelines (native components, proper navigation)
   - Performance: App performs well without crashes (comprehensive error handling)
   - Metadata: App name, description prepared (in app.json)

2. **Google Play Developer Policy Compliance**: App meets Android Play Store requirements:

   - Performance: App performs well
   - Metadata: App name, description prepared (in app.json)

3. **Privacy Policy Implementation (FR52)**: Privacy policy accessible within app:
   - Created privacy policy screen (`src/app/privacy.tsx`)
   - Privacy policy accessible from home screen via "Privacy Policy" link
   - Privacy policy includes required disclosures:
     - Data collection (none - local only)
     - Local data storage (what data is stored)

     - Contact information
   - Privacy policy is accessible and readable

4. **Age/Content Rating**: Appropriate rating determined:
   - Recommended: 4+ (Everyone)
   - Content: Simple game scoring app, no objectionable content
   - No violence, mature themes, or inappropriate content
   - Suitable for all ages

5. **App Icons**: Icons configured in app.json:
   - iOS: Icon path configured (`./src/assets/images/icon.png`)

6. **Screenshots**: Screenshots need to be created:
   - iOS: Need screenshots for different device sizes (iPhone, iPad)
   - Android: Need screenshots for different device sizes (phone, tablet)
   - Screenshots should showcase main features (design/marketing task)

7. **Store Compliance Documentation**: Compliance checklist created:
   - `docs/app-store-compliance-checklist.md` documents compliance status
   - All code-level requirements met
   - Design assets (icons, screenshots) are separate design tasks

## QA Results

### Review Date: 2026-01-23

### Reviewed By: Quinn (Test Architect)

### Code Quality Assessment

Code-level requirements are excellent with privacy policy implemented and compliance verified. However, design assets (app icons, screenshots) are incomplete, which are required for store submission but are design tasks rather than code tasks.

**Strengths:**
- Privacy policy screen implemented and accessible (FR52)
- Comprehensive privacy disclosures (no data collection, local storage, no network access)
- App Store and Play Store compliance verified (code-level)
- Age/content rating determined (4+ / Everyone)
- Compliance documentation created

**Concerns:**
- App icons not created (requires design assets)
- Screenshots not created (requires design/marketing assets)
- These are design tasks, not code tasks, but required for store submission

### Refactoring Performed

No refactoring required. Code quality is excellent.

### Compliance Check

- Coding Standards: ✓ Follows React Native/TypeScript conventions, proper privacy policy implementation
- Project Structure: ✓ Privacy policy screen properly integrated
- Testing Strategy: ✓ Privacy policy accessibility verified
- All ACs Met: ⚠️ AC3 partially complete - code requirements met, design assets pending

### Improvements Checklist

- [x] Privacy policy implemented and accessible (FR52)
- [x] Privacy disclosures included
- [x] Store compliance verified (code-level)
- [x] Age/content rating determined
- [ ] App icons created (design task - pending)
- [ ] Screenshots created (design/marketing task - pending)

### Security Review

Excellent privacy implementation. No data collection, local-only storage, no network access. Meets all store privacy requirements.

### Performance Considerations

No performance concerns. Privacy policy screen loads efficiently.

### Files Modified During Review

No files modified during review.

### Gate Status

Gate: **CONCERNS** → `docs/qa/gates/6.5.app-store-and-play-store-compliance.yml`

**Note:** Code-level requirements are complete and excellent. Design assets (icons, screenshots) are pending but are separate design tasks, not code tasks.

### Recommended Status

⚠️ **Changes Required** - Code is ready, but design assets (app icons, screenshots) need to be created before store submission. These are design/marketing tasks, not code tasks.
