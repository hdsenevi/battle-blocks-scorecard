# Story 6.4: Display Eliminated Players

## Status
Draft

## Story

**As a** user,
**I want** to see which players have been eliminated,
**so that** I know who is still in the game.

## Acceptance Criteria

1. **Given** players have been eliminated (Story 4.2)
2. **When** I view the main game screen
3. **Then** eliminated players are clearly visible:
   - Player names/cards are visually distinct (grayed out, reduced opacity, or marked)
   - Clear indication that they are eliminated
   - Eliminated players are still visible but not interactive for score entry
4. **And** the indication is accessible (screen reader announces elimination status)
5. **And** color coding is supplemented with other indicators (icons, text) for accessibility
6. **And** the visual design follows the design system
7. **And** a Maestro automation test flow is created in `.maestro/flows/` that:
    - Launches the app, creates a new game, adds at least 2 players, and navigates to the main game screen
    - Eliminates a player by entering 3 consecutive misses (score of 0)
    - Verifies eliminated players are clearly visible on the main game screen
    - Verifies player names/cards are visually distinct (grayed out, reduced opacity, or marked)
    - Verifies clear indication that they are eliminated
    - Verifies eliminated players are still visible but not interactive for score entry
    - Verifies the indication is accessible (screen reader announces elimination status)
    - Verifies color coding is supplemented with other indicators (icons, text) for accessibility
    - The test flow is added to the automation regression suite
