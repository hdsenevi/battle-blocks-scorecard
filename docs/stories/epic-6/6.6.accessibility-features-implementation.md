# Story 6.6: Accessibility Features Implementation

## Status
Draft

## Story

**As a** user with accessibility needs,
**I want** the app to support standard platform accessibility features,
**so that** I can use the app effectively regardless of my abilities.

## Acceptance Criteria

1. **Given** I am using the app with accessibility features enabled
2. **When** I interact with the app
3. **Then** the app supports:
   - Screen readers with semantic labels for all interactive elements
   - System font scaling (Dynamic Type iOS, font scaling Android)
   - High contrast mode (WCAG AA minimum contrast ratios)
   - Large touch targets (44x44 points iOS, 48x48 dp Android)
   - Haptic feedback supplements visual feedback
   - Color coding supplemented with icons, text, and patterns
   - Reduced motion preferences respected for animations
4. **And** all game state information is accessible through screen readers
5. **And** the app follows platform accessibility guidelines
6. **And** a Maestro automation test flow is created in `.maestro/flows/` that:
    - Launches the app, creates a new game, adds at least 2 players, and navigates to the main game screen
    - Verifies semantic labels are present for all interactive elements (using testID attributes)
    - Verifies game state information is accessible (scores, player names, game status)
    - Verifies touch targets meet minimum size requirements (44x44 iOS, 48x48 Android)
    - Verifies color coding is supplemented with icons, text, or patterns
    - Verifies the app functions correctly with accessibility features enabled
    - The test flow is added to the automation regression suite

**FRs covered:** NFR35, NFR36, NFR37, NFR38, NFR39, NFR40, NFR41

## Dev Notes

### Project Context
This story ensures the app is accessible to all users, supporting standard platform accessibility features and following accessibility guidelines.

### Source Tree Information
- **All components**: Accessibility features throughout app
- **Accessibility utilities**: Platform-specific accessibility helpers
- **Design system**: Accessibility considerations in design

### Architecture References
- **Screen Readers**: Semantic labels, proper announcements
- **Font Scaling**: Dynamic Type (iOS), font scaling (Android)
- **Contrast**: WCAG AA minimum contrast ratios
- **Touch Targets**: 44x44 iOS, 48x48 Android minimum
- **Reduced Motion**: Respect accessibility preferences
- **Platform Guidelines**: Follow iOS and Android accessibility guidelines
