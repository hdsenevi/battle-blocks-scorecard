# Story 4.2: Automatic Player Elimination

## Status
Draft

## Story

**As a** user,
**I want** players to be automatically eliminated after 3 consecutive misses,
**so that** elimination rules are enforced without manual tracking.

## Acceptance Criteria

1. **Given** a player has consecutive misses tracked (Story 3.7)
2. **When** the player's consecutive_misses reaches 3
3. **Then** the system automatically detects this using checkElimination() (Story 1.4)
4. **And** the player is marked as eliminated (is_eliminated = true in database)
5. **And** the player's status is updated in the game state
6. **And** clear visual feedback is provided:
   - Player's name/card is grayed out or marked visually
   - Visual indicator shows the player is eliminated
   - Clear message explaining elimination ("Player eliminated after 3 consecutive misses")
7. **And** haptic feedback is triggered (appropriate pattern for elimination)
8. **And** eliminated players cannot receive further scores (FR20)
9. **And** the elimination is 100% accurate (NFR22, NFR24)
10. **And** the rule enforcement happens in real-time without perceptible delay (NFR5)
11. **And** all players can see who has been eliminated on the main game screen
12. **And** a Maestro automation test flow is created in `.maestro/flows/` that:
    - Launches the app, creates a new game, adds at least 2 players, and navigates to the main game screen
    - Enters 3 consecutive misses (score of 0) for a player
    - Verifies the system automatically detects consecutive_misses reaches 3
    - Verifies the player is marked as eliminated (is_eliminated = true)
    - Verifies clear visual feedback is provided (grayed out player, elimination indicator, clear message)
    - Verifies haptic feedback is triggered
    - Verifies eliminated players cannot receive further scores
    - Verifies the elimination happens in real-time without perceptible delay
    - Verifies all players can see who has been eliminated on the main game screen
    - The test flow is added to the automation regression suite

**FRs covered:** FR19, FR20, FR39, NFR5, NFR22, NFR24

## Tasks / Subtasks

  - [ ] Check consecutive_misses after miss tracking
  - [ ] Use checkElimination() from gameRules service
  - [ ] Detect when consecutive_misses >= 3
- [ ] Mark player as eliminated (AC: 4, 5)
  - [ ] Set is_eliminated = true in database
  - [ ] Update player in database using database service
  - [ ] Update GameContext state
- [ ] Prevent score entries for eliminated players (AC: 8)
  - [ ] Disable score entry for eliminated players
  - [ ] Check is_eliminated before allowing score entry
  - [ ] Show message if attempting to enter score
- [ ] Create visual feedback (AC: 6, 11)
  - [ ] Gray out or mark eliminated players
  - [ ] Add visual indicator
  - [ ] Display clear message
  - [ ] Show on main game screen
- [ ] Trigger haptic feedback (AC: 7)
  - [ ] Call appropriate haptic pattern for elimination
  - [ ] Ensure haptic completes within 50ms
- [ ] Verify accuracy (AC: 9)
  - [ ] Test elimination detection is 100% accurate
  - [ ] Test exactly 3 misses triggers elimination
  - [ ] Test edge cases
- [ ] Ensure real-time enforcement (AC: 10)
  - [ ] Elimination applies without delay
  - [ ] All players see elimination on main game screen

## Dev Notes

### Project Context
This story implements automatic player elimination after 3 consecutive misses. This is a key game rule that must be enforced accurately and automatically.

### Source Tree Information
- **Game rules service**: `services/gameRules.ts` - checkElimination() function
- **Haptics service**: `services/haptics.ts` - Haptic feedback for elimination
- **Miss tracking**: Story 3.7 (Consecutive Miss Tracking)
- **Score entry**: Stories 3.2, 3.3 - Must check is_eliminated
- **Visual feedback**: `components/game/PlayerCard.tsx` - Show eliminated state
- **Main game screen**: `app/game/[id]/index.tsx` - Display eliminated players

### Architecture References
- **Rule Detection**: Uses gameRules.checkElimination() (Story 1.4)
- **Elimination Status**: Stored in players table is_eliminated column
- **Score Prevention**: Eliminated players cannot receive scores (FR20)
- **Accuracy**: 100% accuracy required (NFR22, NFR24)
- **Performance**: Real-time enforcement without delay (NFR5)

### Dependencies
- Requires Story 1.4 (Game Rules Service) to be completed
- Requires Story 1.5 (Haptics Service) to be completed
- Requires Story 3.7 (Consecutive Miss Tracking) to be completed
- Requires Stories 3.2 and 3.3 (Score Entry) to be modified
- Integrates with Story 4.4 (Visual Feedback)
- Integrates with Story 6.4 (Display Eliminated Players)

### Testing

**Test File Location:**
- Integration tests for elimination rule enforcement
- `services/__tests__/gameRules.test.ts` - Elimination rule tests

**Test Standards:**
- Test elimination detection accuracy (100% coverage)
- Test player marking as eliminated
- Test score entry prevention for eliminated players
- Test visual feedback
- Test haptic feedback
- Test real-time enforcement
- Test edge cases (exactly 3 misses, reset after score)
- Mock game rules and haptics services

**Testing Frameworks:**
- Jest for unit testing
- React Native Testing Library for component testing
