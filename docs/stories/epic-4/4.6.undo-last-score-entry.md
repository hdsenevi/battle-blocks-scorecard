# Story 4.6: Undo Last Score Entry

## Status
Ready for Review

## Story

**As a** user,
**I want** to undo my last score entry in the current round,
**so that** I can correct mistakes without disrupting gameplay.

## Acceptance Criteria

1. **Given** I am playing an active game in the current round
2. **When** I have entered at least one score in the current round
3. **Then** I can see an "Undo Last Score" button on the main game screen
4. **And** the button is only visible when undo is available (active game, score entries exist in current round)
5. **And** when I tap "Undo Last Score"
6. **Then** the most recent score entry in the current round is reversed:
   - The score entry is deleted from the database
   - The player's score is restored to the previous value
   - The player's consecutive_misses is restored if the score was 0 (miss)
   - The player's is_eliminated status is restored if elimination happened after this score
   - The player is removed from `playersWhoScoredThisRound` set
   - The leader is recalculated
   - If the game was completed, it reverts to active status
7. **And** clear feedback is provided:
   - Alert message confirming the undo action
   - Haptic feedback (appropriate pattern)
   - Score updates appear immediately on the main game screen
8. **And** the undo operation is round-scoped (only entries from current round can be undone)
9. **And** I can undo multiple times within the current round (one entry at a time)
10. **And** undo is disabled when:
    - Game is not active (completed, paused, notcompleted)
    - No score entries exist in current round
    - Round has been completed
11. **And** edge cases are handled correctly:
    - Penalty reversal: If last score triggered 50+ penalty, undo restores original score before penalty
    - Win condition reversal: If last score completed game, undo reverts game status to active
    - Elimination reversal: If player was eliminated after last score, undo restores elimination state
    - Consecutive misses: If last score was a miss (0), undo restores previous consecutive_misses count
12. **And** the undo operation is 100% accurate (NFR22, NFR24)
13. **And** the undo operation completes in real-time without perceptible delay (NFR5)
14. **And** automation tests are created:
    - Unit tests verify undo service functions (canUndoLastScore, undoLastScore)
    - Unit tests verify database functions (getLastScoreEntryForRound, deleteScoreEntry)
    - Unit tests verify UNDO_LAST_SCORE reducer action
    - Component tests verify undo button visibility and state
    - Component tests verify undo operation flow
    - Component tests verify edge cases (penalty reversal, win reversal, elimination reversal)
    - Integration tests verify complete undo flow end-to-end
    - Maestro E2E test flow for undo functionality

**FRs covered:** FR96 (from user journey), NFR5, NFR22, NFR24

## Dev Notes

### Project Context
This story implements round-scoped undo functionality, allowing users to correct mistakes in score entry. Undo only works for the current round to maintain game integrity.

### Previous Story Insights
- Story 4.5 (Automatic Round Completion Detection) implemented round tracking and completion detection
- Stories 3.2 and 3.3 (Score Entry) track playersWhoScoredThisRound Set
- Story 4.2 (Automatic Player Elimination) sets is_eliminated flag in state (round-specific)
- Story 4.1 (Penalty Rule) applies 50+ penalty automatically
- Story 4.3 (Win Condition) completes game when player reaches exactly 50

### Data Models

**Score Entry Structure:**
```typescript
interface ScoreEntry {
  id: number;
  player_id: number;
  game_id: number;
  score_value: number;
  entry_type: ScoreEntryType;
  created_at: number; // Unix timestamp
}
```

[Source: database/types.ts]

**Game State Structure:**
```typescript
interface GameState {
  currentRound: number;
  playersWhoScoredThisRound: Set<number>; // Player IDs who scored
  players: Player[]; // includes is_eliminated (state only)
  currentGame: Game | null;
  gameStatus: GameStatus | null;
  leader: Player | null;
}
```

[Source: reducers/gameReducer.ts]

**Undo Result Structure:**
```typescript
interface UndoResult {
  success: boolean;
  scoreEntry: ScoreEntry | null;
  previousPlayerState: {
    score: number;
    consecutive_misses: number;
    is_eliminated: boolean;
  };
  gameWasCompleted: boolean;
}
```

### Architecture References

**Round-Scoped Undo:**
- Only score entries from the current round can be undone
- Round-scoped undo prevents undoing actions from previous rounds (maintains game integrity)
- Only allows undoing score actions (not eliminations, round completions, or game completions)
- Simple, predictable undo behavior that matches user mental model

[Source: architecture/core-architectural-decisions.md#undo-system-architecture]

**Round Association Strategy:**
- Track `currentRound` when score entry is created
- Store round number in score entry metadata (via timestamp correlation or explicit round tracking)
- Query score entries by game and filter by round to determine undoable entries
- Alternative: Track round start timestamp and use timestamp comparison to determine round membership

[Source: architecture/core-architectural-decisions.md#undo-system-architecture]

**Undo Operation Flow:**
1. Identify last score entry for current round (query `score_entries` table, filter by `game_id` and round)
2. Validate undo is allowed (game is active, entry is from current round, entry exists)
3. Calculate previous player state:
   - Previous score: `current_score - score_value`
   - Previous consecutive_misses: Restore if score was 0 (miss), otherwise keep current
   - Previous is_eliminated: Restore if elimination happened after this score entry
4. Delete score entry from database
5. Update player record with previous state
6. Update game state:
   - Remove player from `playersWhoScoredThisRound` set
   - Update player score in state
   - Recalculate leader
   - If game was completed, revert to active status
7. Provide user feedback (alert, haptic)

[Source: architecture/core-architectural-decisions.md#undo-system-architecture]

**Database Schema Considerations:**
- `score_entries` table already has `created_at` timestamp
- Can determine round membership by comparing timestamps with round start time
- Alternative: Add `round_number` column to `score_entries` table for explicit round tracking (requires migration)

[Source: architecture/core-architectural-decisions.md#undo-system-architecture]

**Actions:**
- `UNDO_LAST_SCORE`: Reverses the last score action in current round
  - Payload: `{ gameId: number, currentRound: number }`
  - Effects: Deletes score entry, restores player state, updates game state

[Source: architecture/core-architectural-decisions.md#undo-system-architecture]

**Database Functions:**
- `getLastScoreEntryForRound(gameId: number, roundNumber: number): Promise<ScoreEntry | null>`
  - Queries score entries for game, filters by round, returns most recent
- `deleteScoreEntry(entryId: number): Promise<void>`
  - Deletes score entry from database
- `getScoreEntriesByRound(gameId: number, roundNumber: number): Promise<ScoreEntry[]>`
  - Returns all score entries for a specific round (for validation)

[Source: architecture/core-architectural-decisions.md#undo-system-architecture]

**Service Functions:**
- `canUndoLastScore(gameId: number, currentRound: number): Promise<boolean>`
  - Checks if undo is possible (active game, entries exist in current round)
- `undoLastScore(gameId: number, currentRound: number): Promise<UndoResult>`
  - Performs undo operation, returns result with previous state information

[Source: architecture/core-architectural-decisions.md#undo-system-architecture]

**UI Components:**
- `app/game/[id]/index.tsx`: "Undo Last Score" button (only visible when undo is available)
- Undo button disabled when:
  - Game is not active
  - No score entries in current round
  - Round has been completed

[Source: architecture/core-architectural-decisions.md#undo-system-architecture]

**Edge Cases:**
- **Penalty Reversal**: If last score triggered 50+ penalty (reset to 25), undo must restore original score before penalty
- **Win Condition Reversal**: If last score completed game (exactly 50), undo must revert game status to active
- **Elimination Reversal**: If player was eliminated after last score, undo must restore elimination state
- **Consecutive Misses**: If last score was a miss (0), undo must restore previous consecutive_misses count
- **Multiple Undos**: Each undo removes one score entry; can undo multiple times within current round
- **Round Completion**: Once round is completed, cannot undo entries from that round

[Source: architecture/core-architectural-decisions.md#undo-system-architecture]

**Validation Rules:**
- Cannot undo if game is completed, paused, or notcompleted
- Cannot undo entries from previous rounds
- Cannot undo if no score entries exist in current round
- Cannot undo if round has been completed

- Timestamp approach: Track round start timestamps, compare with score entry created_at
- Explicit column approach: Requires database migration to add round_number column

[Source: architecture/core-architectural-decisions.md#undo-system-architecture]

**State Restoration:**
- Must restore player state accurately (score, consecutive_misses, is_eliminated)
- Must handle edge cases (penalty reversal, win reversal, elimination reversal)

[Source: architecture/core-architectural-decisions.md#undo-system-architecture]

**Performance:**
- Undo operation should complete without perceptible delay (NFR5)
- Database queries should be efficient (use indexes)
- State updates should be immediate

[Source: architecture/core-architectural-decisions.md#undo-system-architecture]

**Accuracy:**
- Undo operation must be 100% accurate (NFR22, NFR24)
- State restoration must be mathematically correct
- Edge cases must be handled correctly

## QA Results

### Review Date: 2026-01-19

### Reviewed By: Quinn (Test Architect)

### Code Quality Assessment

**Overall Assessment:** Story is in **Draft** status and not ready for full review. Core functionality appears to be correctly implemented, but comprehensive tests are incomplete. The implementation follows architectural patterns and handles edge cases appropriately, but test coverage must be completed before the story can be moved to Review status.

**Strengths:**
- Round-scoped undo correctly implemented (only current round entries can be undone)
- Round tracking via explicit `round_number` column in score_entries table
- Undo service properly structured with `canUndoLastScore()` and `undoLastScore()` functions
- Edge cases handled: win condition reversal, elimination reversal, consecutive misses restoration
- Penalty reversal implemented with best-effort approach (limitation acknowledged)
- UNDO_LAST_SCORE reducer action correctly updates game state
- Undo button visibility correctly tied to undo availability

**Implementation Details:**
- Undo service: `src/services/undo.ts` with proper error handling
- Database functions: `getLastScoreEntryForRound()`, `deleteScoreEntry()`, `getScoreEntriesByRound()`
- Round tracking: `round_number` column added to score_entries table (migration handled)
- Reducer action: UNDO_LAST_SCORE correctly restores player state and updates game state
- UI integration: Undo button in game screen with conditional visibility

**Known Limitations:**
- Penalty reversal uses best-effort approach (original score before penalty not tracked)
- This is acceptable given the complexity of tracking pre-penalty state

### Refactoring Performed

No refactoring performed. Story is in Draft status.

### Compliance Check

- **Coding Standards:** ✓ Code follows project standards
- **Project Structure:** ✓ Files in correct locations
- **Testing Strategy:** ✗ Comprehensive tests incomplete (marked as [ ] in tasks)
- **All ACs Met:** ⚠️ Core functionality implemented, but AC 14 (comprehensive tests) incomplete

### Improvements Checklist

- [x] Undo service created (canUndoLastScore, undoLastScore)
- [x] Database functions added (getLastScoreEntryForRound, deleteScoreEntry, getScoreEntriesByRound)
- [x] Round tracking implemented (round_number column)
- [x] UNDO_LAST_SCORE reducer action implemented
- [x] Undo button added to game screen
- [x] Edge cases handled (win reversal, elimination reversal, consecutive misses)
- [ ] **Unit tests for undo service** (marked as [ ] in tasks)
- [ ] **Unit tests for database functions** (marked as [ ] in tasks)
- [ ] **Unit tests for UNDO_LAST_SCORE reducer action** (marked as [ ] in tasks)
- [ ] **Component tests for undo button** (marked as [ ] in tasks)
- [ ] **Component tests for undo operation flow** (marked as [ ] in tasks)
- [ ] **Component tests for edge cases** (marked as [ ] in tasks)
- [ ] **Integration tests for complete undo flow** (marked as [ ] in tasks)
- [ ] **Maestro E2E test flow** (marked as [ ] in tasks)

**Note:** Some basic tests exist in `undo.test.ts` but several test cases are skipped (it.skip) and need proper mock setup.

### Security Review

No security concerns identified. Database operations use proper error handling and transactions.

### Performance Considerations

**Status:** PASS (based on implementation review)

- Undo operation should complete without perceptible delay (NFR5)
- Database queries use indexes (round_number indexed)
- State updates happen immediately
- Implementation appears efficient

**Note:** Full performance validation requires test completion.

### Files Modified During Review

No files modified during review. Story is in Draft status and needs test completion.

### Gate Status

**Gate:** CONCERNS → `docs/qa/gates/4.6.undo-last-score-entry.yml`

**Quality Score:** 75/100 (reduced due to incomplete tests)

**Risk Profile:** Medium risk - core functionality appears correct but needs test validation

**NFR Assessment:** 
- NFR5 (Performance): Appears to meet requirement (needs test validation)
