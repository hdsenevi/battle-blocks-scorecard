# Story 1.6: Set Up React Context State Management

## Status
Completed

## Story

**As a** developer,
**I want** to create GameContext with useReducer for game state management,
**so that** game state is centralized and can be accessed throughout the app.

## Acceptance Criteria

1. **Given** React Context and useReducer are available
2. **When** I set up the state management
3. **Then** the following are created:
   - `contexts/GameContext.tsx` with GameProvider component
   - `reducers/gameReducer.ts` with game state reducer
   - Type-safe action creators for state mutations
   - State structure includes: currentGame, players, gameStatus, leader
4. **And** the GameProvider wraps the app in the root layout
5. **And** state updates are immutable (never mutate existing state)
6. **And** the reducer handles actions: START_GAME, ADD_PLAYER, ADD_SCORE, APPLY_PENALTY, ELIMINATE_PLAYER, COMPLETE_GAME, RESUME_GAME
7. **And** TypeScript types are defined for GameState, GameAction, and all action payloads
8. **And** the context provides hooks for accessing state and dispatching actions

**FRs covered:** FR4, FR11, FR12, FR13, FR24, FR25

## Dev Notes

### Project Context
This story sets up the centralized state management for the game. All game state will be managed through React Context and useReducer pattern, providing a single source of truth.

### Source Tree Information
- **Game Context**: `contexts/GameContext.tsx` - React Context provider for game state
- **Game Reducer**: `reducers/gameReducer.ts` - Reducer function for game state updates
- **Test files**: 
  - `contexts/__tests__/GameContext.test.tsx` - Context tests
  - `reducers/__tests__/gameReducer.test.ts` - Reducer tests
- **Root layout**: `app/_layout.tsx` - Root layout where GameProvider is integrated

### Architecture References
- **State Management**: React Context + useReducer pattern
- **Context Location**: `contexts/GameContext.tsx`
- **Reducer Location**: `reducers/gameReducer.ts`
- **Immutability**: All state updates must be immutable (never mutate existing state)
- **Type Safety**: TypeScript types for GameState, GameAction, and action payloads
- **Action Types**: START_GAME, ADD_PLAYER, ADD_SCORE, APPLY_PENALTY, ELIMINATE_PLAYER, COMPLETE_GAME, RESUME_GAME

### State Structure
- **currentGame**: Current game instance data
- **players**: Array of players in the current game
- **gameStatus**: Status of the game (active/completed/paused)
- **leader**: Current leader/winner information

### Dependencies
- Uses React Context and useReducer (built-in React hooks)
- Will integrate with database service (Story 1.3) in future stories

### Testing

**Test File Location:**
- `contexts/__tests__/GameContext.test.tsx` - GameContext tests
- `reducers/__tests__/gameReducer.test.ts` - GameReducer tests

**Test Standards:**
- Test GameProvider provides state and dispatch
- Test all reducer actions (START_GAME, ADD_PLAYER, ADD_SCORE, etc.)
- Test state immutability (verify new objects created, not mutated)
- Test custom hooks for accessing state
- Test edge cases (empty state, invalid actions, etc.)
- Test action creators return correct action objects

**Testing Frameworks:**
- Jest for unit testing
- React Testing Library for context testing
- Mock React Context for isolated reducer testing
