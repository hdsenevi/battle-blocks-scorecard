# Story 2.2: Add Players to Game

## Status
Completed

## Story

**As a** user,
**I want** to add players to a game (minimum 2, no maximum),
**so that** all participants can be tracked in the game.

## Acceptance Criteria

1. **Given** I am on the new game setup screen (Story 2.1)
2. **When** I enter a player name and tap "Add Player"
3. **Then** the player is added to the game with:
   - Initial score of 0
   - consecutive_misses set to 0
   - is_eliminated set to false
4. **And** the player is saved to the database with the game_id
5. **And** the player appears in the player list on screen
6. **And** I can add additional players (no maximum limit)
7. **And** the "Start Game" button is enabled only when at least 2 players are added (FR2)
8. **And** if I try to start with less than 2 players, I see a clear error message
9. **And** player names are validated (not empty, reasonable length)
10. **And** the UI provides visual feedback when a player is added

**FRs covered:** FR2, FR3, FR24, FR26

## Dev Notes

### Project Context
This story implements player management for new games. Users can add players with validation, and the system enforces the minimum 2 players requirement.

### Source Tree Information
- **New game screen**: `app/game/new.tsx` - Player addition interface
- **Database service**: `services/database.ts` - Used to save players
- **Game Context**: `contexts/GameContext.tsx` - Used to update game state
- **Game Reducer**: `reducers/gameReducer.ts` - Handles ADD_PLAYER action
- **Validation utilities**: `utils/validation.ts` - Player name validation

### Architecture References
- **State Management**: GameContext with ADD_PLAYER action
- **Database Integration**: Uses database service addPlayer() function
- **Validation**: Input validation utilities for player names
- **Minimum Players**: 2 players required (FR2)
- **No Maximum**: No limit on maximum players

### Dependencies
- Requires Story 2.1 (Create New Game Flow) to be completed
- Requires Story 1.3 (Database Service) to be completed
- Requires Story 1.6 (Game Context) to be completed

### Testing

**Test File Location:**
- `app/__tests__/game/new.test.tsx` - New game screen tests
- `utils/__tests__/validation.test.ts` - Validation tests

- Test database save for players
- Test GameContext state update
- Test "Start Game" button enable/disable logic
- Test minimum 2 players requirement
