# Story 1.1: Initialize Project with Expo TypeScript Template

## Status
Draft

## Story

**As a** developer,
**I want** to set up the Expo TypeScript project with Expo Router,
**so that** I have a solid foundation for building the Battle Blocks Scorecard app.

## Acceptance Criteria

1. **Given** the project needs to be initialized (or verified if already exists)
2. **When** I run the Expo CLI command to create the project
3. **Then** the project structure includes:
   - TypeScript configuration with strict type checking
   - Expo Router file-based routing setup
   - Basic app structure with `app/`, `components/`, `constants/`, `hooks/` directories
   - Package.json with React Native 0.81.5 and Expo SDK ~54.0 dependencies
   - TypeScript configuration files (tsconfig.json, expo-env.d.ts)
4. **And** the project follows Expo best practices for React Native development
5. **And** the project is ready for NativeWind integration (if not already configured)

**FRs covered:** FR47, FR48, FR49

## Tasks / Subtasks

- [ ] Verify or initialize Expo TypeScript project (AC: 1, 2)
  - [ ] Check if project already exists and verify structure
  - [ ] If needed, run Expo CLI to create project with TypeScript template
  - [ ] Verify Expo Router is configured
- [ ] Configure TypeScript with strict type checking (AC: 3)
  - [ ] Verify/update tsconfig.json with strict settings
  - [ ] Ensure expo-env.d.ts exists
- [ ] Verify project structure matches requirements (AC: 3)
  - [ ] Verify `app/` directory exists with Expo Router setup
  - [ ] Verify `components/`, `constants/`, `hooks/` directories exist
  - [ ] Create directories if missing
- [ ] Verify package.json dependencies (AC: 3)
  - [ ] Check React Native version (0.81.5)
  - [ ] Check Expo SDK version (~54.0)
  - [ ] Update if needed
- [ ] Verify NativeWind readiness (AC: 5)
  - [ ] Check if NativeWind is configured
  - [ ] Verify tailwind.config.js exists if NativeWind is used

## Dev Notes

### Project Context
This story establishes the foundation for the Battle Blocks Scorecard app. The project uses Expo with TypeScript and Expo Router for file-based routing.

### Source Tree Information
- **Root level**: `package.json`, `tsconfig.json`, `app.json`, `expo-env.d.ts`
- **App routing**: `app/` directory with Expo Router file-based routing
- **Components**: `components/` directory for React components
- **Constants**: `constants/` directory for app constants
- **Hooks**: `hooks/` directory for custom React hooks

### Architecture References
- Project uses Expo TypeScript template with Expo Router (from architecture decisions)
- File-based routing in `app/` directory
- TypeScript with strict type checking enabled

### Testing

**Test File Location:**
- No tests required for this story (project setup/verification)

**Test Standards:**
- This is a setup/verification story, not requiring unit tests
- Manual verification of project structure and configuration is sufficient
