# Story 3.1: Score Entry Interface

## Status
Draft

## Story

**As a** user,
**I want** to access a score entry interface to add scores for players,
**so that** I can record scores during gameplay.

## Acceptance Criteria

1. **Given** I am on the main game screen with an active game
2. **When** I tap on a player's name or card
3. **Then** a score entry interface appears
4. **And** the interface clearly shows:
   - The player's name
   - Current score
   - Options to enter single block or multiple blocks
5. **And** the interface has large touch targets (44x44 points iOS, 48x48 dp Android)
6. **And** the interface is accessible (screen reader support, proper labels)
7. **And** UI transitions appear smoothly (< 200ms per NFR2)
8. **And** the interface follows the design system (NativeWind styling)

**FRs covered:** FR32, NFR2, NFR35, NFR36, NFR37
