# Story 3.3: Enter Multiple Blocks Score

## Status
Draft

## Story

**As a** user,
**I want** to enter a score when multiple blocks are knocked over,
**so that** the score equals the count of blocks (e.g., 3 blocks = 3 points).

## Acceptance Criteria

1. **Given** I am on the score entry interface for a player (Story 3.1)
2. **When** I select "Multiple Blocks" and enter the count of blocks (e.g., 3)
3. **Then** the score is calculated as the count (3 points)
4. **And** the score is added to the player's current total
5. **And** the score entry is saved to the database with entry_type = "multiple_blocks"
6. **And** the score update appears instantly (< 100ms per NFR1)
7. **And** haptic feedback is triggered (light impact per Story 1.5)
8. **And** the main game screen updates to show the new score
9. **And** the score entry interface closes and returns to main game screen
10. **And** invalid inputs (negative, zero, non-numeric) are handled with clear error messages
11. **And** the distinction between single block (number) vs multiple blocks (count) is clear in the UI

**FRs covered:** FR8, FR10, FR13, FR23, FR34, NFR1, NFR7

## Dev Notes

### Project Context
This story implements multiple blocks score entry, where the score equals the count of blocks. Similar to Story 3.2 but with different calculation logic.

### Source Tree Information
- **Score entry component**: `components/game/ScoreEntry.tsx` - Score entry interface
- **Game rules service**: `services/gameRules.ts` - calculateScore() function
- **Database service**: `services/database.ts` - addScoreEntry() function
- **Haptics service**: `services/haptics.ts` - triggerScoreEntry() function
- **Game Context**: `contexts/GameContext.tsx` - ADD_SCORE action

### Architecture References
- **Score Calculation**: Uses gameRules.calculateScore() with isMultiple=true
- **Database**: Saves entry_type = "multiple_blocks"
- **Performance**: Score update < 100ms (NFR1)
- **Haptics**: Light impact haptic for normal score entry
- **UI Clarity**: Must clearly distinguish single vs multiple blocks

### Dependencies
- Requires Story 3.1 (Score Entry Interface) to be completed
- Requires Story 1.4 (Game Rules Service) to be completed
- Requires Story 1.5 (Haptics Service) to be completed
- Requires Story 1.3 (Database Service) to be completed
- Requires Story 1.6 (Game Context) to be completed

### Testing

**Test File Location:**
- `components/game/__tests__/ScoreEntry.test.tsx` - Score entry tests

**Test Standards:**
- Test multiple blocks score calculation
- Test score addition to player total
- Test database save with correct entry_type
- Test haptic feedback trigger
- Test UI update performance (< 100ms)
- Test input validation
- Test UI clarity for single vs multiple distinction
- Mock game rules, database, and haptics services

**Testing Frameworks:**
- Jest for unit testing
- React Native Testing Library for component testing
