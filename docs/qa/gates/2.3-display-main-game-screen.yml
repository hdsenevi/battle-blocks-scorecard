status_reason: "All acceptance criteria fully implemented with excellent code quality. Maestro E2E flow provides comprehensive coverage and leader calculation is tested at reducer level. However, component tests mentioned in story testing section are missing (main game screen and PlayerCard), which would complete the test pyramid and provide faster feedback."
