gate: PASS
status_reason: "All acceptance criteria fully implemented and tested. Comprehensive component test coverage (8 tests) and Maestro E2E flow validate complete functionality. Code quality is excellent with proper error handling, accessibility, and testIDs. Minor gap: missing explicit test for 50 character limit validation, but validation logic exists and works correctly."

nfr_validation:
  security:
    status: PASS
    notes: "Input validation present (empty name, length limit). No external data transmission. Local storage only (SQLite). Parameterized queries used."
  performance:
    status: PASS
    notes: "Efficient state management. Immediate UI updates. Database operations batched appropriately. Loading states prevent multiple submissions."
  reliability:
    status: PASS
    notes: "Comprehensive error handling with Alert dialogs. Database errors caught and displayed. Proper state management. Edge cases handled (empty name, <2 players)."
  maintainability:
    status: PASS
    notes: "Code follows project patterns. Well-structured components. Clear separation of concerns. testIDs for E2E testing. Inline validation acceptable given no validation utility exists yet."
