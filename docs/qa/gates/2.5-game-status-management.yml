story_title: "Game Status Management"
gate: PASS
status_reason: "All acceptance criteria fully implemented with excellent code quality. Status management is properly integrated throughout the app. Comprehensive database service tests added (21 tests covering all status filtering functions). Reducer tests validate status transitions and Maestro E2E flow provides foundation for testing. Component tests not applicable (status displayed inline, not separate component). Maestro flow appropriately notes limitations for full completion testing."

nfr_validation:
  security:
    status: PASS
    notes: "Database CHECK constraint enforces valid status values. Status-based access control prevents unauthorized modifications. No external data transmission. Local storage only (SQLite)."
  performance:
    status: PASS
    notes: "Status filtering uses indexed queries (idx_games_status). Efficient query patterns. Status checks in UI are fast (simple string comparisons)."
  reliability:
    status: PASS
    notes: "Database CHECK constraint ensures data integrity. Status transitions properly handled. Status-based access control prevents invalid operations."
  maintainability:
    status: PASS
    notes: "Code follows project patterns. Well-structured status management. Clear separation of concerns. Status values properly typed (GameStatus type)."
